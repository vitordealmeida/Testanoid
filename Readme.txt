Given the project “Architecture Test”, please refactor the project taking into consideration the following key points:

- KISS principle 
- decoupling data and representation
- composition over inheritance
- single responsibility principle
- application of design patterns where possible

The project will be evaluated by the following, in order of importance (high to low):

- complexity of the code (is the code simple to understand?)
- readability of the code (is the code easy to read?)
- robustness (how hard is it to make the app crash?)
- gameplay polish (is the gameplay behaving in a nice way?)

The project has been designed with a 9:16 ratio in portrait mode.
We would like you to maintain this ratio, however if you would like to support other aspect ratios please feel free.
